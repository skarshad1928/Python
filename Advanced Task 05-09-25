Ah! You want **web scraping tasks/questions** that are **safe and legal** (don’t violate terms of service) so you can practice without risking bans or illegal activity. Here’s a list of options and resources you can use:

---

## **1️⃣ Safe Websites for Practice**

These sites allow scraping or have open APIs:

1. **Books to Scrape** – [http://books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com)

   * Fake bookstore for practicing scraping titles, prices, ratings.

2. **Quotes to Scrape** – [http://quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com)

   * Practice scraping quotes, authors, and tags.

3. **OpenWeatherMap API** – [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)

   * Use API to fetch weather data. APIs are safe for learning.

4. **IMDB Top 250 (via OMDb API)** – [http://www.omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com)

   * Safe access to movie data through an API.

5. **JSONPlaceholder** – [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

   * Fake online REST API for testing and learning.

## **2️⃣ Sample Web Scraping Task Ideas**

## **3️⃣ Guidelines for Safe Web Scraping**

1. Always **check `robots.txt`** of a site.
2. Avoid scraping sensitive or private data.
3. Don’t overload servers; use **delays (`time.sleep`)**.
4. Prefer **APIs** if available.

If you want, I can make a **ready-to-use list of 20+ safe web scraping exercises** with links, difficulty levels, and ideas for using **OOP, threading, and file handling** for each.

Do you want me to make that list?
